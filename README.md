# 🧠 Student Depression Prediction using Machine Learning
## This project explores the use of various machine learning algorithms to detect signs of depression among students based on their responses to mental health-related questions and lifestyle indicators. The goal ## is to support early intervention by identifying students at risk.
# 📁 Dataset
## The dataset includes features like:
## 1. Sleep patterns
## 2. Study hours
## 3. Social activity
## 4. Stress levels etc
# 🎯 Problem Statement
## To classify students into:
## Not Depressed
## Mildly Depressed
## Severely Depressed
# 🧪 Algorithms Used
## 1. Logistic Regression
## 2. Decision Tree
## 3. Random Forest
## 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
# 🛠️ Preprocessing
## Handling missing values
## Label encoding / One-hot encoding (for categorical variables)
## Feature scaling using StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler
## Train-test split
#  📊 Evaluation Metrics
## 1. Accuracy
## 2. Precision
## 3. Recall
## 4. F1-score
## 5. Confusion Matrix
# 📌 Objective
## To build a reliable and interpretable model that can aid counselors, teachers, or educational institutions in identifying students who may require mental health support.
